These are for 15.0.1

- Download https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk15.0.1/51f4f36ad4ef43e39d0dfdbaf6549e32/9/GPL/openjdk-15.0.1_windows-x64_bin.zip (by pasting this on your browser window)
- Extract the file
- Open https://justinmahar.github.io/easyjre/ in browser. Pick option 2 in box 1. Then "Windows" in box 3.
- In the terminal, run .\java --list-modules | clip
- Go to box 4 in that page and click on paste
- In box 5 (customize Your JRE), search for jdk.unsupported (and other things to add - see readme) in the left box, check that and move them to the right box.
- There will be a command shown in the last box, copy that and paste that in your terminal, and run it.
- The above will create a folder named (something like) "jre-15.0.1".
- Zip that folder, and send it to me on slack.
